# Sign Language Detection

## Overview

This project is a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focused on Sign Language Detection. It serves as a simple demonstration or portfolio site and is deployed on Render.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following key files and directories:

- `js/` - Directory for JavaScript files handling interactivity and functionality.
- `css/` - Directory for CSS stylesheets.
- `images/` - Directory for image assets used in the site.
- `index.html` - The main entry point HTML file.
- `README.md` - Project documentation (this file).
- `proposal.pdf` - Project proposal document.
- `synopsis.pdf` - Project synopsis.
- `project.pdf` - Detailed project report.

Optional folders may include `fonts/` and `styles/` for additional resources.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Handles styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.

## Deployment on Render

To deploy the site on Render:

1. Push this repository to Render (select New Static Site).
2. Configure the repository link.
3. Leave the Build command empty (as it's a static site).
4. Set Publish directory to `.` (root).
5. Click Create Static Site.
6. Your site will be live shortly after.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/aps4934/Sign-Language-Detection.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the site.

## Additional Information

This project likely includes documentation in PDF format detailing the Sign Language Detection implementation, such as algorithms, datasets, or models used (e.g., computer vision for gesture recognition). For full technical details, refer to the PDF files in the repository.

If this is part of a larger application (e.g., using MediaPipe or OpenCV for detection), the static site may serve as a frontend demo.
